## Laboration statistiska metoder

1. The linear regression code is in the file __LR.py__

2. The functionality is demonstrated in the file __Linear_Regr.ipynb__

3. Because the X-variables show high mutual dependency, we try a different approach in __Linear_Regr_extra.ipynb__.

4. Finally, we check if there is any observer bias in __Observer_bias.ipynb__.
